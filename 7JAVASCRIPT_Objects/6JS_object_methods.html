<!--Objects can also have methods.
  Methods are actions that can be performed on objects.
  Methods are stored in properties as function definitions.-->
<h2>JavaScript Objects</h2>

<p>An object method is a function definition, stored as a property value.</p>

<p id="demo"></p>
<!--A method is a function stored as a property. -->
<script>
// Create an object:
var person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName : "Doe",
  secondLastName : "Badillo",
  id     : 5566,
  fullName : function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + " " + this.secondLastName;
  }
};
// Display data from the object:
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = person.fullName();
</script>
<!-- The this Keyword
  In a function definition, this refers to the "owner" of the function.
  In the example above, this is the person object that "owns" the fullName function.
  In other words, this.firstName means the firstName property of this object.
